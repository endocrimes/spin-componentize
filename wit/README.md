# Wit

Wit files are used by the abi conformance testing to generate code that interacts with components generated by spin-componentize. These are taken from the "crates/wasi/wit" directory in commit [8e261ac4](https://github.com/rylev/wasmtime/commit/8e261ac452ff54031efe2fde804cdf63fded3e55) on the github.com/rylev/wasmtime fork of wasmtime.
